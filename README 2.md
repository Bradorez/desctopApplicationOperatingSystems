CPU Scheduling Simulator (GTK4)
 
Introduction & Features
This application is a CPU Scheduling Simulator with a GTK4-based graphical interface.
It helps users understand how various CPU scheduling algorithms behave by simulating process scheduling with a clean visual UI.
Supported Scheduling Algorithms:
●	First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS)
●	Shortest Job Next (SJN)
●	Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)
●	Round Robin (RR)
 Main Features:
●	Interactive GTK4 GUI
●	Add and simulate custom processes
●	Visual timeline of process execution

 
How to Compile and Run
Requirements:
●	GTK4 development libraries
●	GCC
●	A Unix-like OS (Linux/macOS recommended)
 
 
To Compile:

1.	Navigate to the project directory
2.	Open a terminal and run:
./compile.sh
./App
This script will compile the source code and produce an executable file, and then launch the application itself.

 
Using the Application
1.	Start the Simulator
Launch the program. The main interface should appear.
2.	Choose an Algorithm
Select one of the following:
○	FCFS
○	SJN
○	SRT
○	Round Robin (configure time quantum)
3.	Add Processes
Enter the process details:
○	Process ID/Name
○	Arrival Time
○	Burst Time
Click “Add Process” to queue it.
4.	Run Simulation
Click “Start Simulation” to begin.
5.	View Results



 

 
Algorithms in Action
🔹 FCFS (First-Come, First-Serve)
●	Non-preemptive
●	Executes processes in the order they arrive
●	Simple, but may cause long waits for short jobs
🔹 SJN (Shortest Job Next)
●	Non-preemptive
●	Picks the job with the shortest burst time
●	Can lead to starvation for longer jobs
🔹 SRT (Shortest Remaining Time)
●	Preemptive version of SJN
●	Can interrupt a running job if a shorter one arrives
●	More efficient, but complex logic
🔹 Round Robin
●	Preemptive with time quantum
●	Fair time-sharing model
●	Each process gets CPU for a short slice (e.g., 2 seconds)
